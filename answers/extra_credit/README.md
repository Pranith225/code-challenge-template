# weather data API on AWS

To deploy the weather data API, database, and scheduled data ingestion on AWS, I would follow the approach outlined below:

	1. AWS Elastic Beanstalk
	2. Amazon RDS
	3. AWS Lambda
	4. Amazon EventBridge
	5. Amazon S3
	6. AWS IAM
	7. Amazon CloudWatch
	8. Amazon API Gateway


## Approach

### API Deployment: 

First, I would deploy the Flask API using AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Elastic Beanstalk simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of web applications, including APIs. To deploy the application, I would package the application code, requirements.txt, and other necessary files into a .zip file and upload it to Elastic Beanstalk. AWS will handle deployment, scaling, monitoring, and maintenance automatically.

#### Database Migration: 

I would migrate the postgres database to Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) using either PostgreSQL or MySQL for better performance and scalability. RDS manages database backups, maintenance, scaling, and replication, making it an ideal choice for this application.

### Scheduled Data Ingestion: 

To run the data ingestion code on a schedule, I would use AWS Lambda and Amazon EventBridge. I would package the ingestion code as a Lambda function, which allows serverless execution of code in response to events or on a schedule. I would then set up an EventBridge rule to trigger the Lambda function periodically (e.g., daily) to run the data ingestion.

### Raw Data Storage: 

I would store the raw weather data files in an Amazon S3 bucket, enabling the Lambda function to access the files directly from S3 during the data ingestion process. S3 is a scalable and cost-effective storage service suitable for storing large amounts of raw data.

### IAM Roles and Permissions: 

To ensure secure access between different AWS services, I would configure appropriate IAM roles and permissions. For instance, the Lambda function would need permission to read data from S3 and write data to the RDS instance. Similarly, the Elastic Beanstalk environment should have the necessary permissions to access the RDS database.

### Monitoring and Logging: 

I would use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the API, Lambda function, and RDS instance. CloudWatch offers monitoring, logging, and alerting capabilities, helping detect and troubleshoot issues with the application.

### API Gateway (optional): 

Optionally, I could use Amazon API Gateway to create a custom domain, manage access control, and enable additional security features (e.g., rate limiting, API keys) for the API. Although Elastic Beanstalk provides a default URL and basic security features, API Gateway allows for more granular control and management of the API.
